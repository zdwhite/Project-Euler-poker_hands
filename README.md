Solving Various Project Euler Problems. Found via https://projecteuler.net/

Each problem is listed in a sub folder with the name of the problem as the sub folder title, not the ID number

Various problems are listed ina  jupyter notebook that were solved prior to me switching to coding in a text editor.

the purpose of this is to keep in touch with my git skills and show regular commits to my github repo, because for some reason people care about this.
